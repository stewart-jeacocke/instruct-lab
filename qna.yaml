      5.1 For the purposes of this Article:
      (a) "electronic authentication" means the process or act of verifying the identity of a party to an electronic communication or transaction, or ensuring the integrity of an electronic communication; and
      (b) "electronic signature" means data in electronic form that is in, affixed to, or logically associated with an electronic data message and that may be used to identify the signatory in relation to the data message and indicate the signatory's approval of the information contained in the data message.

      5.2 Except in circumstances otherwise provided for under its laws or regulations, a Party shall not deny the legal effect, legal validity, or admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings of an electronic signature solely on the basis that the signature is in electronic form.

      5.3 No Party shall adopt or maintain measures that would:
      (a) prohibit parties to an electronic transaction from mutually determining the appropriate electronic authentication method or electronic signature for that transaction; or
      (b) prevent parties to an electronic transaction from having the opportunity to establish before judicial or administrative authorities that their transaction complies with any legal requirements with respect to electronic authentication or electronic signatures.

      5.4 Notwithstanding paragraph 3, a Party may require that, for a particular category of transactions, the method of authentication or electronic signature meets certain performance standards or is certified by an accredited authority in accordance with its laws or regulations.

      5.5 To the extent provided for under its laws or regulations, each Party shall apply paragraphs 2 to 4 to electronic seals, electronic time stamps, and electronic registered delivery services.
