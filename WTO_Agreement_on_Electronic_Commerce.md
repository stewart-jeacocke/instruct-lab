# JOINT STATEMENT INITIATIVE ON ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
26 July 2024

The following communication, dated 2 6 July 2024 is being circulated at the request of Australia, Japan and Singapore as Co-Convenors on behalf of the participants[^1] of the Joint Statement Initiative on Electronic Commerce.

___

We recognise the importance of global electronic commerce and the opportunities it creates for inclusive trade and development, and the important role of the WTO in promoting open, transparent, non-discriminatory and predictable regulatory environments in facilitating electronic commerce.

After five years of negotiations under the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on Electronic Commerce, participants have reached a new phase, achieving stabilised text on the attached Agreement on Electronic Commerce that reflects a balanced and inclusive outcome. The Agreement is set to benefit consumers and businesses involved in digital trade, especially MSMEs. It will also play a pivotal role in supporting digital transformation among participating members.

Participants will proceed with their domestic processes, with a view to integrating the outcome of negotiations in the WTO legal framework.

We reaffirm the importance of supporting developing and least-developed country Members in implementing the Agreement on Electronic Commerce by addressing their identified needs including through implementation periods, technical assistance and capacity building support.

Taking note of the evolving nature of cross-border electronic commerce and digital technology, participants recognise that some issues of importance to digital trade have not been addressed in this text. Participants will discuss the inclusion of these issues in future negotiations. Participants reserve the right in any future negotiations to propose amendments to the attached Agreement including with respect to scope, exceptions and dispute settlement.

We encourage all WTO Members to support and join this Initiative and, in this context, we will extend our outreach to WTO Members on the benefits of the negotiated rules for facilitating electronic transactions.

We acknowledge that some Members that participated in negotiations continue to undertake internal consultations or domestic processes and we commit to continued engagement with these Members in coming months with the goal of expanding participation.

[^1]: Due to ongoing domestic consultations and considerations, this statement is circulated on behalf of Joint Statement Initiative participants, except for Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Paraguay, Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, TÃ¼rkiye and United States.

Agreement, either bilaterally or through relevant international organizations.

20 .9 The results of any needs assessment conducted or updated in accordance with paragraph 8
should inform the self-designation of provisions by a developing or least-developed country
Party under paragraph 6 and the extension of any implementation period under paragraph 7.

20 .10 The Parties recognize the importance of technical assistance and capacity building for the
full implementation of all provisions of this Agreement. To this end, developing country and
least-developed country Parties may identify any provision of this Agreement in respect of
which they would most benefit from technical assistance and capacity building. Developed
country Parties, and developing country Parties in a position to do so, agree to facilitate the
provision of assistance and support for capacity building in respect of such provisions, either

extended an implementation period under paragraphs 6 or 7, respectively, for the duration
of the implementation period applicable to that provision.

20 .14 Notwithstanding the grace period referred to in paragraph 12, before a Party requests
consultations under Article 27 concerning a measure of a least-developed country Party, and
at all stages of any dispute settlement procedures thereafter, it shall give particular
consideration to the special situation of least-developed country Parties. In this regard, the
Parties shall exercise due restraint in raising matters under Article 27 involving least-
developed country Parties.

20 .15 The Parties recognize the importance of transparency in the provision of assistance and
support for capacity building to facilitate the effective implementation of this Agreement. To
this end, the Parties shall endeavour to discuss in the first meeting of the Committee and
regularly thereafter, relevant information^16 on their existing and new technical assistance
and capacity building programmes. To enhance this discussion, in advance of the first
dedicated session of the Committee and regularly thereafter, each developed country Party
shall submit a description of relevant technical assistance and capacity building programmes.
Developing country and least-developed country Parties that have received technical
assistance and capacity building are encouraged to share their experiences. The Parties
intend to use these submissions to help better understand whether existing programmes are
meeting the needs expressed by developing country and least-developed country Parties.

## ANNEX

This Annex sets out principles on the regulatory framework for basic telecommunications services.

**Section I: Competitive safeguards**

1.1 Prevention of anti-competitive practices in telecommunications

Appropriate measures shall be maintained for the purpose of preventing suppliers who, alone or
together, are a major supplier from engaging in or continuing anti-competitive practices.

1.2 Safeguards

The anti-competitive practices referred to in paragraph 1.1 include, in particular:

```
(a) engaging in anti-competitive cross-subsidization;
```
```
(b) using information obtained from competitors with anti-competitive results; and
```
```
(c) not making available to other services suppliers on a timely basis technical
information about essential facilities and commercially relevant information which
are necessary for them to provide services.
```
**Section II: Interconnection**

2.1 This Section applies to linking with suppliers providing public telecommunications transport
networks or services in order to allow the users of one supplier to communicate with users
of another supplier and to access services provided by another supplier, where specific
commitments are undertaken.

2.2 Interconnection to be ensured

```
Interconnection with a major supplier will be ensured at any technically feasible point in the
network. Such interconnection is provided:
```
```
(a) under non-discriminatory terms, conditions (including technical standards and
specifications), and rates and of a quality no less favourable than that provided for
its own like services or for like services of non-affiliated service suppliers or for its
subsidiaries or other affiliates;
```
```
(b) in a timely fashion, on terms, conditions (including technical standards and
specifications), and cost-oriented rates that are transparent, reasonable, having
regard to economic feasibility, and sufficiently unbundled so that the supplier need
not pay for network components or facilities that it does not require for the service
to be provided; and
```
```
(c) upon request, at points in addition to the network termination points offered to the
majority of users, subject to charges that reflect the cost of construction of necessary
additional facilities.
```
2.3 Public availability of the procedures for interconnection negotiations

```
The procedures applicable for interconnection to a major supplier will be made publicly
available.
```
2.4 Transparency of interconnection arrangements

```
It is ensured that a major supplier will make publicly available either its interconnection
agreements or a reference interconnection offer.
```

### - 25 -

2.5 Interconnection: Dispute settlement

```
A service supplier requesting interconnection with a major supplier will have recourse,
either:
```
```
(a) at any time; or
```
```
(b) after a reasonable period of time which has been made publicly known,
```
```
to an independent domestic body, which may be a regulatory body as referred to in
Section V, to resolve disputes regarding appropriate terms, conditions, and rates for
interconnection within a reasonable period of time, to the extent that these have not been
established previously.
```
**Section III: Universal service**

Any Party has the right to define the kind of universal service obligation it wishes to
maintain. Such obligations will not be regarded as anti-competitive _per se_ , provided they are
administered in a transparent, non-discriminatory, and competitively neutral manner and are not
more burdensome than necessary for the kind of universal service defined by the Party.

**Section IV: Public availability of licensing criteria**

4.1 Where a licence is required, the following will be made publicly available:

```
(a) all the licensing criteria and the period of time normally required to reach a decision
concerning an application for a licence; and
```
```
(b) the terms and conditions of individual licences.
```
4.2 The reasons for the denial of a licence will be made known to the applicant upon request.

**Section V: Independent regulators**

The regulatory body is separate from, and not accountable to, any supplier of basic
telecommunications services. The decisions of and the procedures used by regulators shall be
impartial with respect to all market participants.

**Section VI: Allocation and use of scarce resources**

Any procedures for the allocation and use of scarce resources, including frequencies, numbers
and rights of way, will be carried out in an objective, timely, transparent, and non-discriminatory
manner. The current state of allocated frequency bands will be made publicly available, but detailed
identification of frequencies allocated for specific government uses is not required.
